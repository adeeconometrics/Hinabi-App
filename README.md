# Hinabi-App
The Hinabi app aims to have fast, easy and convenient transactions with social welfare services on the fly.

Everyone is affected by the pandemic, but the magnitude of how people are affected varies. Due to most of them having limited mobility, people with disabilities are struggling with accessing basic social services and immediate government assistance. Mobile applications show great potential for making these government services accessible to sectors that are “traditionally underserved”. Hinabi weaves these government social services together into a single unifying app that’s convenient, user-friendly, and accessible to all Filipinos. Adobe XD is used in designing the interface, and Flutter in implementing the design. The philosophy behind Hinabi is coherence and simplicity -- making its features easy to use and comprehend. It leverages on inclusivity and usability -- making it a powerful tool for the Filipino community to have access to basic social services for it is a right everyone should have.
